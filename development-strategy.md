i. User story 1 : As a user I should see content when I click page link

- [x] Create 'markup' branch
- [x] make index.html boiler
- [x] Boilerplate set-up & links to cdn bootstrap: or use starter template & test
- [x] Prepare site texts and add title and header
- [x] Create a PR

ii. User story 2 : As a user I should see main color theme of the page

iii. User story 3 : As a user I should see an About section which includes my short bio with a title on the left and a self-portrait on the right for full size (desktop) and laptop size.
The positions should shift right-to-left for the tablet-size, and title of section should be aligned with portrait on the left.
Phone screen should have portrait on top of the bio & title

iii. Improvements

1. Make items collapse automatically when another is clicked to show.
   Potential challenge: bootstrap collapse does not work with dynamic content #2274
   [Issue 2274](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/2274)
2. Structure think on media queries
3. Dark/Light Theme
4. Make Interfaces page, call it 'pages' not cards. Potential to sell themes. Inspiration from google page, and envato themes.
5. Add a php blog page to write articles in my own page similar to plural sight guides with language icons. Should be 2 pages, one with all the articles, and on click to another page to read the clickable one. Pay attention to details. header pix, name, title, date, category, Main: cards format, copy pastable code, scrollable content, highlight fixed left nav. If article was in table-one card is enough
6. Creat games tabs, and remove articles in its place, and include link to blog. In portfolio add ariana, recipe and voxbox. In team add .....???
7. Idea: write on errors: al steps you took to debug everything with links to github issues i agreed with, or asked, overstock my answer, etc
